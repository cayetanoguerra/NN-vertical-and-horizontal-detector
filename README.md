# NN-vertical-and-horizontal-detector
A neural network to detect vertical and horizontal lines

This code creates a neural net to detect vertical and horizontal lines as the pdf file explains. To do it I have used Tensorflow.

There is an interesting thing in this net, it does not work! It is unable to separate both classes. However, if
the train samples or the classes are changed slightly, it works. Why? Try to give an answer.

Remember that in order to run the code you need to install Tensorflow and Numpy.
